# Flowday

Flowday is a lightweight student workflow optimizer that creates a realistic daily study plan based on time, energy level, task difficulty, and deadlines.

Instead of acting like a static planner, Flowday adapts plans to how students actually work.

## Problem

Most student planners assume:
- the same energy every day
- perfect focus
- accurate time estimates

In reality, students:
- feel low energy on some days
- get distracted
- underestimate how long tasks take

This leads to unrealistic plans, stress, and burnout.

## What Flowday Does

Flowday helps students decide what they should *actually* work on today.

It:
- prioritizes tasks by deadline
- adjusts task time based on difficulty and energy
- generates a realistic daily plan
- adapts when focus is interrupted

The goal is not to do more work, but to make plans achievable.

## How It Works

1. The student adds tasks with:
   - subject
   - estimated time
   - difficulty
   - deadline

2. The student selects their energy level for the day.

3. Flowday generates a prioritized daily plan that fits within the available time.

4. During focus sessions, if the student gets distracted, the plan adapts instead of forcing unrealistic goals.

## Why This Is Different

Traditional planners are static and guilt-driven.

Flowday:
- adapts to real behavior
- respects mental energy
- adjusts plans when things go wrong

It focuses on sustainability, not pressure.
